This lab course supplements [BIO302: Human
Anatomy](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio302/).  Although we cannot
virtually replicate the lab experience, this “lab” will familiarize you
with scientific thinking and techniques and will enable you to explore
of some key principles of human anatomy. The material in this lab
supplement relates to the material covered in the lecture and reading
portion of the course.  While that portion focuses more on large-picture
concepts, here we will focus more on visual understanding, manipulation,
and practical use of your knowledge.  You will review the anatomy and
histology of the organs by using images of models, microscopic slides,
and videos on cat and sheep dissections.  Then you will be asked to
assess your knowledge, which eventually can be put to practical or
experimental use.  Working though this lab supplement, you will realize
that you must memorize new terms and locate different structures and
organs, which can only be achieved by repetition and practice. Note:
This course makes use of several online demos hosted by Stanford
University.  These resources require the Adobe Shockwave plugin, which
can be downloaded for free
[here](http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/alternates/#sp).  These
demo labs often take a while to load; please be patient and read the
lower left-hand corner “loading” information to determine the status of
the lab. Co-requisite: [BIO302: Human
Anatomy](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio302/).
