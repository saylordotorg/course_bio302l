     Instructions: Please use the links under “Body Organization and
    Body Systems” to assess your knowledge of "Surface (Regional)
    Terminology", "Body Parts", "Body Cavities", "Dorsal and Ventral
    Cavities", "Abdominopelvic Regions and Quadrants", and "Organs and
    Organ Systems".   
        
     Follow the instructions on the webpage, answer the questions, and
    then use the keys to grade yourself.  Each link is accompanied by a
    key or a link to a fully labeled image.  To test your knowledge,
    name the parts without the answer keys or links and then check your
    answers.  Specifically, use the links “Surface (Regional)
    Terminology” and “Body Planes” to practice anatomical terms and
    definitions. Use the links to “Body Cavities,” “Dorsal and Ventral
    Cavities,” and “Abdominopelvic Regions and Quadrants” to review body
    cavities and regions.  Lastly, use the link to “Organs and Organ
    System” (organs of the torso) to study organ location.
