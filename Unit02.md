**Unit 2: Classification of Tissues** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this section, we will focus on histology and practice identifying
different tissue types using microscopic images.  An understanding of
the differences between various epithelial and connective tissues will
be emphasized.  *

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**
