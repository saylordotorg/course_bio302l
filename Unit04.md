     Instructions: Please use the links “Anatomy” and “Skeletal
    Anatomy,” and then review the “Skeleton” section.  The image
    presents an overview of “Axial” and “Appendicular” Skeletons.

     Instructions: Please review each link under “Axial Skeleton.” It is
    important that you learn the terms and the locations of all parts so
    that, if given a bone, you would be able to identify where in the
    body it belongs. Also, when you are asked to identify various parts
    on that bone you should be able to name them.
