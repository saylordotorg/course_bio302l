**Unit 6: Muscular System** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this section, you will label the muscles, including the anterior and
posterior muscles, using cat dissections.  This unit will also review
“Muscle Tissues” using microscopic slides. *

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 10 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Review each link under “Muscle Models.”  Review only
    the links to “Skeletal,” “Smooth,” and “Cardiac” under
    “Histology.”   You should be able to identify and differentiate the
    microscopic images of these three types of muscles.  Note that it is
    important that you learn to identify and locate each of these
    muscles so that, when given a model, you are able to identify where
    in the body the muscle belongs.
