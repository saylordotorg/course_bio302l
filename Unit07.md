**Unit 7: Nervous System** <span id="7"></span> 
*In this section, you will label different structures of the brain,
spinal cord, and identify the cranial and spinal nerves using sheep and
human models.  This unit reviews the histology of the nervous tissue as
well.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours to complete.
