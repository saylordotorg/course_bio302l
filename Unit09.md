id="9"></span> 
*This section will teach you how to label the heart’s structures using
heart models as well as cat and pig heart dissections. You will also be
asked to identify the tissues of different blood vessels using
microscopic images. *

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 8 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please review the links under “Cardiovascular
    System,” including “Histology,” “Models,” and “Dissection.”  You
    should be able to identify and differentiate the images of the
    different blood types, blood vessels, and blood diseases under
    microscope.  It is important that you learn the heart’s structures
    so that, given a model, you are able to label the parts.
