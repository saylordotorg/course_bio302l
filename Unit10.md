**Unit 10: Respiratory System** <span id="10"></span> 
*In this section, you will learn how to label the structures located
within the respiratory system using models as well as cat dissection. 
You will also practice identifying tissues located in trachea, bronchi,
and alveoli using microscopic images. *

**Unit 10 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please review the links under “Respiratory System,”
    which consist of links to “Histology,” “Models,” and “Cat
    Dissection.”  You should be able to identify not only the tissues
    located in the trachea, bronchi, and alveoli, but also the
    structures that lie within these tissues using a microscope. Using
    the model and the cat dissection, you should practice identifying
    the structures of the respiratory system, especially the lungs and
    larynx.
