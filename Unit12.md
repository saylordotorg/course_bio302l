**Unit 12: Urinary System** <span id="12"></span> 
*This section will teach you how to label the structures located within
the urinary system using models and cat dissections.  Using microscopic
images, you will also practice identifying tissues located within the
urinary system. *

**Unit 12 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please review the links under “Urinary System,” which
    consist of links to “Histology,” “Models,” and “Sheep Dissection.” 
    Using the microscope images, you should be able to identify the
    tissues located in renal cortex and medulla, glomerulus, and
    ureter.  Furthermore, using the models and the sheep dissection, you
    should practice identifying the urinary system’s structures and
    organs.
