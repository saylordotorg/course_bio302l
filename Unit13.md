**Unit 13: Reproductive System** <span id="13"></span> 
*This section will teach you how to label the structures located within
the female and male reproductive systems using models and cat
dissections.  Using microscopic images, you will also practice
identifying tissues located within both reproductive systems. *

**Unit 13 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please review the links under “Reproductive System,”
    which consist of links to “Histology,” “Models,” and “Cat
    Dissection.”  You should be able to identify tissues of organs
    located in both female and male reproductive systems using
    microscopic slides.  You should also use the models and the cat
    dissections to practice identifying the structures and organs of the
    female and male reproductive systems.
